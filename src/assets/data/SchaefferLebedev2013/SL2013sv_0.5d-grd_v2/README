TYPE:
 This contains files with the model pre-gridded onto an evenly-spaced
 lat-lon grid (0.5 degrees). For the model grid (the points solved for
 in the inversion), please use the archive: SL2013sv_tri-grd

If you have any questions regarding the methodology or the construction
of the model, please contact the authors. If you use the model, we would
request that you cite the reference indicated below, and appreciate
your feedback regarding the model and its application.

Summary: construction of the model.
The inversion is parameterized to solve for 3D perturbations in P, S and
2-Psi Azimuthal Anisotropy (S) with respect to a 3D global reference
model. It is computed using a multi-step procedure: seismograms are fit
using Automated Multimode Inversion to generate a set of linear
equations describing sensitivity-volume average perturbations with
respect to the 3D reference model; the linear equations from the
successfully fit seismograms are then combined together into one large
linear system, and solved using LSQR; finally, systematic outlier analysis
is carried out to select only the most mutually consistent seismograms for
use in the final model. SL2013sv is constrained by more than half-a-
million vertical-component, Rayleigh-wave seismograms, selected from a
dataset of >700,000 successful fits.

The model is parmeterized on a set of concentric shells. Each shell
consists of knots on a triangular grid, which have an approximately
constant inter-knot spacing of around 280 km (7842 shell knots total).
Vertically, there are 18 S-velocity stem nodes, parameterized using
triangular basis functions, at depths:
7, 20, 36, 56, 80, 110, 150, 200, 260, 330, 410-, 410+, 485, 585, 660-,
660+, 810, and 1008 km.
For P, there are 10 stem nodes at depths:
7, 20, 36, 60, 90, 150, 240, 350, 485, and 585 km.
Between the knots of the grid, values are computed using linear
interpolation.

Mantle discontinuities are parameterized using pairs of knots, with
410+ and 660+ at the top and 410- and 600- at the bottom of the
discontinuity. In the model, the top knots are represented as 410 and 660,
and the bottom ones as 411 and 661. In total there are 501,888 unknown
model parameters:
7842 shell nodes x (18x3 S parameters + 10 P parameters). The x3 S
parameters in depth are for the azimuthally isotropic S velocity and the
two azimuthal anisotropy terms.

The reference model is a 3D reference model which consists of two parts.
Beneath the Moho, the reference model is 1D, and based on AK135. We
re-compute AK135 to a reference period of 50s. The Moho depth varies
spatially and is defined by the 3D crustal reference model, which is
based on Crust2.0. As a result, the reference velocity in the crust
varies as a function of lat-lon. Finally, a set of 1D velocity shifts
are applied across the depth of range of the model. These velocity
shifts are derived from an initial smoothed inversion.

Although the model includes both P velocity and 2-Psi S-wave azimuthal
anisotropy, the files included in this distribution are only the Vsv
components. The 2-Psi azimuthal anisotropy will be distributed in a
later release.

aforementioned reference, Schaeffer & Lebedev, 2013.

This archive contains the following files:
  SL2013sv_n-0.5d.mod
  SL2013sv_25k-0.5d.mod
  README (this file)

SL2013sv_n-0.5d.mod:
 The Vsv model at the model shell nodes, interpolated onto an evenly-
 sampled 0.5 degree lat-lon grid.

SL2013sv_25k-0.5d.mod:
 The Vsv model interpolated onto an evenly-sampled 0.5 degree lat-lon
 grid horizontally, sampled more densely in depth:
  25--700km every 25km

The columns in both model files are:
# Depth (km)   lon         lat      dVs (m/s)  VsRef (m/s)   dVs (%)   VsAbs (m/s)   VsMean (m/s)   dVsM (%)
20.0        -180.0000    -90.0000   -211.0678   3722.5132    -5.6700    3511.4454     4177.5300     -15.9445
20.0        -179.5000    -90.0000   -211.0678   3722.5132    -5.6700    3511.4454     4177.5300     -15.9445


The perturbations (column 4) are in m/s from the reference model (column 5),
also in m/s. Please see the note below about the reference model. The
perturbations in percentage (column 6) are with respect to the 3D reference
model also. Column 7 is the absolute velocity (dVs + VsRef) in m/s. Finally,
Column 8 is the mean velocity computed for that depth, with Column 9 being
the perturbation with respect to the mean.



***PLEASE NOTE***
In the mantle, perturbations are with respect to a 1D model very similar
to AK135. At shallower depths (i.e., shallower than the Moho) the
perturbations are with respect to the 3D crustal reference model, which
is given in column 5. Therefore, perturbations (columns 4 and 6) plotted
at crustal depths do not reflect the total variation in amplitude (peak-
to-peak, at that depth), given that there is also variation in the
reference model. To properly represent the total peak-to-peak range in
pertubrations, use the perturbations with respect to the mean.

*** Plotting ***
The model can be plotted using GMT. First grid files must be generated, then
they can be plotted, using a colourmap. For example, 150 km depth:
