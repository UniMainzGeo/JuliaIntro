I like how the content is divided into four main real-world applications of computational thinking, which made learning very enjoyable and also made working with Julia easier for me.</p><p>I also found it amazing that this class provided applications of topics in differential equations and linear algebra classes and added a new way to view them. Unfortunately, I haven't found a similar class on computational thinking for the spring as the skills I gain are very practical and needed in research (I was impressed by the number of MISTI research opportunities that asked for experience with agent-based modeling or modeling in general.)</p>"),
